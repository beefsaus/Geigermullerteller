Simple Geiger-Mullercounter based on RadiationD-v1.1 CAJOE board and LILYGO TTGO T4 (ESP32 based).
Displays a sliding average (60s) counts per minute
Displays current counts per second
Displays total counted counts


Switching pages:
The middle button is used to switch pages. Internally this is GPIO 37.

Battery voltage:
Measured using the internal ADC of the ESP32 which is wired to GPIO35 internally. 


Deepsleep:
Implemented deepsleep on GPIO 39 (top button). Wake-up is only possible during 32 seconds after entering deepsleep.  This is limited by the onboard IP5306 which removes power after 32s of low load  (> 45mA) in deepsleep. Consider soldering RST pin to a front pushbutton to restore power. I used GPIO 38.
